# SFMLAudioVisualizer
This audio visualiser uses FFT(Fast Furier Transform) to create frequency domain in real time and SFML library to render it.  

Works for Windows only. WAV audio format is the only supported (may be changed in future versions).  
Before running the executable copy every folder from /resources to executable directory.

Fluid simulation used in one of the visualizers is based on Jos Stam's paper: https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/public_user/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf
